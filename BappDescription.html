<p>Add to sitemap+ can read URLs from files or clipboard and add the discovered information on the site map of the selected host(s).</p>

<p>Information doesn't need to be structured, only readable strings. Regular expressions will handle the information.</p>

<p> The extension can handle many kinds of files but must be in URL structure (example https://www.example.com/), tested files are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>plaintext files</li>
	<li>xml files</li>
	<li>zip files (containing text files)</li>
	<li>docx, xlsx, pptx</li>
	<li>Vulnerability scanner files from Nessus, Acunetix, Dirb and Nikto (with htm output) maybe more only tested on these</li>
</ul>

<p>Note:</p>

<ul>
	<li>URLs will only be imported for the host you right-clicked on when choosing the extension in the context menus</li>
	<li>You may need to adjust the Site map filter to view all imported URLs</li>
</ul>
